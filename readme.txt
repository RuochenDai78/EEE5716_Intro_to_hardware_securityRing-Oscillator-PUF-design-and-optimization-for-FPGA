There are 2 folders in the folder "Hardware implementation".

"sources_1" folder contains 2 folders, "ip" folder contains the block
RAM instantiated in Vivado, and "new" folder contains source VHDL code
we designed for implementation.

"constrs_1" folder contains our constarins when performing hard-maro after

Here are 4 folder, which contained the results data and program used to analyse them.
Reliabiliy, Uniformity and Intra-hamming Distance and Uniquess.

Clerification: the results you run may have sligtly different from the figure in report. That is because the 
environment and shortage of data we use(onnly 100 responses).
